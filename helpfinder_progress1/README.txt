-----------Work Distribution--------------
For this week Abhi started the main project because we were together and then he later shared the files with us. 
He created the main activity and formnated the login screen. Then I was able to do the linking of login and signup button to their own activities. 
Tahir was responsible for setting up the backgroud and color combinations. Overall, Abhi and I are focusin on the User Experience and backend side of the project while tahir is focused more on the Design aspect of it.
