----------Summary------------------

This is our third progress report for our project helpfinder app. Previosuly we created a login screen,
where user can type usernmae and email and if the hit the login button it goes to a second Activity. 
We demonstrated what our login screen looked like. We also created a signup form where users who did not have an account
can use the signup button to signup for the app.

For this week, we chose to implememnt the search bar in our app, to search for services that are being offered by different sellers who are signed up
It was definetly interesting to do this feature in android studio. Compared to other features, this was one of the most complicated on thus far. I had to 
watch few videos in order to successfully integrate it in our app. 
Our progress for this week was not where we wanted it to be. We had planned to add more features as well but due to exams and other assignment issues with
our group members, we were only able to get the very minimum done.


----------Next Plan------------------

Next, we plan on moving further with our "create a seller profile" aspect of the app. We plan on asking the user relevant information
such as their first and last name, current zip code, If they would like to link their paypal to receice money. I understand that implementing payment
features brings a whole new level of challanges and compkexity for us but we would like to give it a try.



-----------Work Distribution--------------
For this week, I was responsible for doing the background again. I kept it the same as previous activity because I felt it more appealing to me.
Abhi and tahir worked on getting the search bar to work. We all watched youtube video and then came together to help each other. we were able to get
it to work just as we wanted. Again, I believe us as a group are very well driven to successfully complete this project and everyone is equally contributing.
