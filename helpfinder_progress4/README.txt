----------Summary------------------

This is our fourth progress report for our project helpfinder app. Previosuly we created a login screen,
where user can type username and email and if they hit the login button it goes to a second Activity. 
We demonstrated what our login screen looked like. We also created a signup form where users who did not have an account
can use the signup button to signup for the app. We also created a search bar activity where users can search for different services that are being offer 

For this week, we decided to add a screen(Progress 4A) where user can decide if they want to search for a service or creat a seller profile. Each account 
will only be able to creat one seller profile. And then we took the create a seller profile concept further. For seller profile, we decided to ask the user to
create a business name, Serivices they are planning to offer, their location and also other details that they would like to display in their profile. 


----------Next Plan------------------

Next, we plan on adding if a user searches for a service, what it would look like and what kind of details will it display about the seller. 



-----------Work Distribution--------------
For this week, I was responsible for doing the main activites and abhi helped with constraining and formating. Tahir was responsible for showing how the screen
should look. He drew it out on a piece of paper and abhi and I were able to create that in android studio. We all contributed equally this week to reach our work
goals.
