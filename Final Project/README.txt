----------Final Submission------------- 

This is our helpfinder final submission. I have uploaded the src folder which has all the files needed to run. I have also uploaded .apk file to run.
I also have the whole project helpfinder.zip uploaded just incase there are any files missing. The zip folder should have everything in it.

I would say our app works but I wish we had more time so we could make the login page and creat a user account page be more realistic.

This project allowed us to learn a lot about android studio and what can be done with it. I personally went from not knowing anything to at least having about 
40-50% more knowledge about the software and how to work in it.
