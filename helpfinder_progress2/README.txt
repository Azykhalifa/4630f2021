----------Summary------------------

This is our second progress report for our project helpfinder app. Previosuly we created a login screen where user can type usernmae and email and if the hit the login button it goes to a second Activity. We demonstrated what our login screen looked like. 

For this week, We decided to focus more on our sign up aspect for the user. We mutually agreed on what information should we ask the user. We felt like asking the user for their First, Last Name and email would be sufficient. We allowed them to create username and password in order to make their login process easier once the account is created. We added a submit button, which validates all the information and creats the user profile. Also, upon hitting submit button, it takes the user to the next activity which would be the "Looking for services or Looking to advertise their service" screen. The users who login with username and password would also be directed to the same second activity. 


----------Next Plan------------------

Next, we plan on moving further with our "looking for services" perpective of the app. We will be adding a search bar and also a list of services that is able to show up once the user enters certain information. We are also lookoing to work on the "create a seller profile" for the app. We have to discuss what information we will be requesting from the user if the want to advertise their skill. 



-----------Work Distribution--------------
I was responsible for making sure that the format was perfect. The reason why I decided to do a different background than previous activity is because we are still trying to figure out the color scheme for our app. So right now we are testing few different backgrounds and color schemes. Tahir was responsible for making the submit button work and linking the activites. Abhi created the activity "Sign up for HelpFinder" and also add the input text view for first name, last name, email, username and password. Overall, it was a well contributed successfull group work week.
