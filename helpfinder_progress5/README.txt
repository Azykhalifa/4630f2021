----------Summary------------------

This is our fifth progress report for our project helpfinder app. Previosuly we created a login screen,
where user can type username and email and if they hit the login button it goes to a second Activity. 
We demonstrated what our login screen looked like. We also created a signup form where users who did not have an account
can use the signup button to signup for the app. We also created a search bar activity where users can search for different services that are being offer 
we also add a screen(Progress 4A) where user can decide if they want to search for a service or creat a seller profile. we took the create a seller profile 
concept further by asking them for their business name, location (zip code), their services and rates.

For this week, We created an activity which shows what the seller profile would look like if a user were to search for one and then click on one. As you can see
in the progress 5.png file, We have the profile picture displaying up top and then we have the ratings of the seller out of 5 stars. I think that is important
because it will help decide the buyer if they want to move further or not. Then we have their bussiness name and also a button which they can click to read the 
sellers review. Then we have all the other important details such as services, rates, location and any other details the seller would like the buyer to know. 
Lastly, we created a button which would allow the buyer to send seller a message if they have any concers or to finilaze the project. 


----------Next Plan------------------

we are trying to work on implemnting the messaging future within the app.



-----------Work Distribution--------------
For this week, abhi and I created the activity. Tahir was responsible for making the profile picture work and also do the constrains as well as the color formating
I believe it turned out great just as we had on our layout. If we had more time, we would have added more features.
